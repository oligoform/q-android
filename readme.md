**Q for Android, Favorites Addon Demo** is a demo theme for mobile apps built with WP-AppKit, a WordPress plugin to create mobile apps connected to WordPress (more on that at http://getwpappkit.com).

This **Favorites Demo** version version of Q for Android implements a _favorites_ feature
allowing to set some posts as favorite, which will store them to be read later, even
if all app content has been refreshed in the meantime.

This _Favorites_ version **requires the [Offline Favorites Addon](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wpak-addon-offline-favorites) to be installed**.
See the addon page for install instructions and theme implementation details.

Here is how we implement the _Favorites_ logic in the _Q for Android_ theme, followed by the corresponding HTML code which implements the _Favorites_ CSS classes logic (as defined on the [addon's page](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wpak-addon-offline-favorites)):
- in _archive.html_ and _single.html_ templates we add a "star" element for each post. When clicking the star, the post is added to favorites. Re-clicking the star removes it from favorites list.
- a new template _archive-favorites.html_ (based on _archive.html_ template) is used to render the favorite list (it must be called exactly that for the addon to recognize it) .
- somme CSS customizations are made in theme's css files to render the favorites "stars" correctly.

Exemple of "favorite toggling" HTML code that is added to _archive.html_, _single.html_ and _archive-favorites.html_:

```
<!-- First we check that the addon is activated for the app -->
<% if( TemplateTags.addonIsActive( 'wpak-addon-favorites' ) && TemplateTags.isComponentTypeLoaded( 'favorites' ) ) { %>
  <!-- Note the use of TemplateTags.getPostDataAttributes() and WpakFavorites.getIsFavoriteClass() -->
  <div class="favorite-toggle <%= WpakFavorites.getIsFavoriteClass( post.id ) %>" <%= TemplateTags.getPostDataAttributes( post.id ) %>>
    <svg class="favorite-star" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="..."/></svg>
  </div>
<% } %>
```

# Theme's Overview

## What's implemented
At the moment, Q for Android theme implements:
* A shiny material design UI (including transitions and ripple effect)
* Off-canvas menu (you can update it in the app's edit panel)
* Archive template (eg. post list) with infinite post list
* Single template (eg. a post) with the most common HTML elements (eg. strong, em, blockquote...)
* Responsive embeds
* The refresh process
* Offline cache (meaning that you can read loaded posts offline)
* Post thumbnail captions and subhead support
* A responsive interface

## Android UI
* Ripple effect
* Status bar color matches the theme
* Android spinner

## Cordova Plugins
Q for Android relies on Cordova plugins to:
* Customize the iOS status bar: [https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar)
* Open external links in default browser (ie. Chrome): [https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)

WP-AppKit export function adds these plugins automatically to your *config.xml* file. If you don't use the export, make sure to add them in order the theme to be able to work properly.

## Responsive Images
Q for Android hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify the source code of images in the post content. It eases the way to style the responsive images later. See *prepare-content.php* in the *php* folder of the themes.

## Thumbnail Captions and Subheads
Q for Android hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify add thumbnail captions and subheads (if available) in the post content. See *add-custom-data.php* in the *php* folder of the themes. Note that subheads are expected as a post custom field.
